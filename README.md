Spatial_Analysis_in_R_Learnr_Example 2

This is an example of a R Learnr tutorial from the Spatial Analysis in R workshop course I taught in Summer 2022.  The course is located here:

This the module 2. Spatial Packages for R, which introduces the sf and stars packages for reading shapefile and raster grid files, respectively.  The module also demonstrates the arcpullr package for reading spatial features directly from ArcGIS Online.

Note: not every step in the module is a Learnr exercise.  To keep the module responsive, I read data from the data folder, and display code chunks and the results of the code in Rmarkdown.  There is at least one Learnr "exercise" and "quiz" in the module.

This module was uploaded to Shinyapps.io and can be run from there.

This builds on module 1, which I also uploaded as a separate repository on my github account.
